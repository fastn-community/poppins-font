Poppins: fastn Font Package

This repository contains a [fastn font package](https://fpm.dev/featured/fonts/) containing [Google Font: 
Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins/about).

Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the worldâ€™s stage. Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre.

Designers: Indian Type Foundry, Jonny Pinhorn
